# paralenz/actions
This is a mono-repo containing all sorts of github actions that is commonly use by the paralenz development team

## Publishing a new version
It is fairly easy to publish a new version.

The workflow is setup so when ever a pull request is merged into the `master` -branch it will automaticlly create a new release. For this we will use the `version` in `package.json` to set the correct tag and release name.

#### So what happens in the `release`-workflow?
1. First we will lint the ts code using `@paralenz/eslint-config-typescript-react`
1. Documentation will be generated based on all `action.yml` files in this project. The newly generated documentation will be pushed to github
1. We will use the `version` from `package.json` to create a new tag and a new release with the specific version. The tag and release will be prefixed with `v` (v1.0.0)
1. ðŸ’° Profit
